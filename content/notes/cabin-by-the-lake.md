Sam Altman 曾用一个生动的比喻，来描述他理想中的 AI 体验。

他认为，智能手机更像是纽约的时代广场：信息轰炸、注意力被不断撕扯；  
而 OpenAI 想做的，是一间「湖畔小屋」——  
当你需要专注时，可以关上门，把噪音留在外面。

> “One of the things that I think has gone wrong with modern technology…  
> when I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York, constantly dealing with flashing lights in my face… it’s unsettling.
>
> With the kind of AI we’re trying to build, you can go for a vibe that is not like walking through Times Square,  
> but like sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake in the mountains, just enjoying the peace and calm.”
>
> —— Sam Altman
